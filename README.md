This Project is a clone of https://open.spotify.com/ that I've made for my HyperionDev bootcamp.

It was made to showcase my understanding of functional React components, but along the way I decided to 
reasearch React hooks, and incorporated some of those too.

This taught me a lot about React and css as well, and I learned a lot of useful front-end skills while making this.

in the future, I'd definitely like to revisit this and make it so that you can play more songs than just Gangnam Style!
